# Vehicle Attributes and Their Role in CO2 Emission

## Overview
According to NASA, since the beginning of the industrial era and the growth of the automobile industry, the level of CO2 in the atmosphere has increased by 50%. While opinions differ on the effects of rising CO2 levels, the topic has garnered significant interest across various disciplines. Some argue that the increase has contributed to global warming, while others highlight potential benefits, such as improved global photosynthesis and plant growth.

This project does not aim to resolve these debates. Instead, it focuses on identifying and analysing the key factors influencing CO2 emissions, particularly in the context of vehicle attributes. By understanding these relationships, we can contribute to data-driven discussions on emissions and their management.

## Project Goals
- Investigate the relationship between vehicle attributes (e.g., weight, engine size, fuel type) and CO2 emissions.
- Analyse trends and derive actionable insights using data visualisation and statistical techniques.
- Highlight the importance of specific vehicle characteristics in mitigating emissions.

## Why Use a Jupyter Notebook for This Project?
Jupyter Notebooks are ideal for this project because they allow for interactive data exploration, seamless integration of code and explanations, and clear visualisation of results. Additionally, this analysis was carried out using R.

## Key Findings
Details on key insights and recommendations derived from the analysis are documented in the notebook and accompanying outputs. These findings aim to support efforts in reducing CO2 emissions through informed decision-making in vehicle design and policy.
